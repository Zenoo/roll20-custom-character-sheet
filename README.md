# questrpg-roll20-character-sheet-template
Custom Roll20 Character Sheet Template for T.C. Sottek's tabletop game, "Quest"


#Installation 

I'll eventually get this into the Roll20 Character Sheet Repo for easier installation, but for now, you'll need to do the following to use it:

1.) Create an Adventure
2.) Go to Adventure Settings and under the **Character Sheet Template** Select "Custom"
3.) Copy `questrpg.html` code from this repo into "HTML Layout"
4.) Copy `questrpg.css` code from repod into "CSS Styling"
5.) Click Save and You should be good to go.
