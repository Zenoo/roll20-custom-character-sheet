# questrpg-roll20-character-sheet-template
Custom Roll20 Character Sheet Template for T.C. Sottek's tabletop game, <a href="https://www.adventure.game/">Quest</a>.

## Version 1.0

This is version 1.0, it works, but it ain't pretty. I tried to model it after the Quest RPG character profile and worksheet, but I tweaked a few things based on my experiences with how Roll20 is used. I will jazz up the formatting in the future, but we may never have complete parity with the visual of the official Quest character handouts since there are limitations to what kind of font families Roll20 let's you use in a custom character sheet.


## Installation 

I'll eventually get this into the Roll20 Character Sheet Repo for easier installation, but for now, you'll need to do the following to use it:

1.) Create an Adventure <br/>
2.) Go to Adventure Settings and under the **Character Sheet Template** Select "Custom" in the drop down menu. <br/>
3.) Copy and paste the `questrpg.html` code from this repo into "HTML Layout" section. <br/>
4.) Copy and paste the `questrpg.css` code from repod into "CSS Styling" section. <br/>
5.) Click Save and you should be good to go. <br/>
